# Ways to cool down

* Shut windows and pull down the shades (or close curtains) when it is hotter outside. You can open the windows for ventilation when it is cooler
* Avoid the heat: stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm (the hottest part of the day) if you're vulnerable to the effects of heat Wear loose, cool clothing and a hat and sunglasses if you go outdoors
* Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated
* Check up on friends, relatives and neighbours who may be less able to look after themselves.
* Keep rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows. If this isn't possible, use light-coloured curtains and keep them closed (metallic blinds and dark curtains can make the room hotter)
* Have a cool bath or shower, and splash yourself with cool water
* Listen to alerts on the radio, TV and social media about keeping cool
* Plan ahead to make sure you have enough supplies, such as
food, water and any medications you need
* Identify the coolest room in the house so you know where to go to keep cool.
* Please remember to stay at a safe social distance to prevent the spread of COVID-19
